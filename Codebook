The run_analysis.R script:
    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

        Original data set:
        https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
 
    Useful datasets and the corresponding names
  
        features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
        The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
       
       activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
        List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
        
        subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
        contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
       
       test_x <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
        contains recorded features test data
        
        test_y <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
        contains test data of activities’code labels
        
        subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
        contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
        
        train_x <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
        contains recorded features train data
       
       train_y <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
        contains train data of activities’code labels

   2 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
       
       x_train_and_test (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging train_x and test_x using rbind() function
        y_train_and_test (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging train_y and test_y using rbind() function
        complete_data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Y and X using cbind() function

    3 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
        Final_data (10299 rows, 87 columns) is created by subsetting complete_data, selecting only columns: id and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation

    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
        
        
    4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
        activity_id with the name of the activities
         Acc ---- Accelerometer
         Gyro ----- Gyroscope
         BodyBody ----- Body
         Mag ------- Magnitude
         f ---- Frequency
         t----- Time

   5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
        Summarized_data  is created using group_by(activities) and  taking the means of each variable for each activity.
        This summarized_data is exported into a text (.txt) file.
